# NestJS Snippets for WebStorm

This project provides a collection of code snippets for developing a backend application with NestJS in the WebStorm IDE. The goal of this project is to help developers increase their productivity and reduce the time and effort required to create common NestJS components such as controllers, services, and modules.

## Motivation

Developing a backend application with NestJS requires creating and configuring a variety of components, including controllers, services, modules, and more. While these components are essential for building a robust and functional backend application, they can be time-consuming and repetitive to create from scratch.

By providing a collection of code snippets for these components, this project aims to simplify and streamline the development process for NestJS backend applications. With these snippets, developers can quickly and easily create high-quality components without having to spend time writing boilerplate code or performing tedious configuration tasks.

## Usage

This project currently provides the following snippets:

- `nest c`: Create a new NestJS controller.
- `nest s`: Create a new NestJS service.
- `nest m`: Create a new NestJS module.

To use these snippets, simply type the appropriate command in your code editor and the snippet will be inserted into your code.
